            <p>
                My goal for BOLT is to have a simple, easy to use and learn
                language that anyone can pick up almost instantly. <br>
                It can't do much, but it's very good for learning. <br>
                To keep the 'easy to use and learn' aspect of this afloat,
                I try and keep a list of all commands updated and
                avaiable for anyone to look at, and see what a command does. <br>
                Hope this helps!

                    Initalize a variable, and set it to a value. <br>
                    (Personally, I would suggest keeping the
                    names as short as possible!)
